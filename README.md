Fedora on R1
===

This repo is primarily a fork of http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/kernel.git,
applying patches from OpenWRT to allow the correct functioning of the Broadcom
switch on the Lamobo R1 router board, namely for the swconfig and b53 kernel
modules. Also contains a specfile for the swconfig CLI application.
